Problem Statement

What kinds of financial experiences do individuals and families have at different income levels? There are many decisions 
in life that could be better-informed if one had a good sense of that: which career to pursue, how to manage starting 
and growing a family, and what retirement goals to set. Plenty of resources are available to teach people about valuable 
personal finance skills, like budgeting, saving, and investing. Studies have also been done to help people understand 
what a living wage or "modest yet adequate" income threshold would be under certain circumstances 
(http://livingwage.mit.edu and https://www.epi.org/resources/budget, respectively). However, with the degree of privacy
surrounding people's personal financial situations, more could be done to help people get a "feel" for life at different
incomes.

This website is intended as a safe place for people to share and explore what different incomes feel like for different 
households. I would like visitors to get a taste of this by using a tool to look up homes that are affordable based on
career and location. New registered users will be required 
to complete a short survey about their financial situation the past year before they can see survey results of other 
members.  At a third level of engagement, members will be able to provide and search for more detailed information about
what it has been like to handle routine needs and wants, emergencies, and financial goals at their income level. 
Finally, users will be able to interact with other users by responding to their personal stories about income.

//////////////////////////////////// TODO ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Sort out which information is stored/presented in profile and which better fits a forum. Consider that
annual income and family size will change year to year, and I"m planning to adjust data to current-year
values and continue using it for aggregate data. 

Also consider a sign-up term, with new basic info required each year (with some kind of grace period).
