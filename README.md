# Income Experiences

## Problem Statement

What kinds of financial experiences do individuals and families have at different income levels? There are many decisions 
in life that could be better-informed if one had a good sense of that: which career to pursue, how to manage starting 
and growing a family, and what retirement goals to set. Plenty of resources are available to teach people about valuable 
personal finance skills, like budgeting, saving, and investing. Studies have also been done to help people understand 
what a living wage or "modest yet adequate" income threshold would be under certain circumstances 
(http://livingwage.mit.edu and https://www.epi.org/resources/budget, respectively). However, with the degree of privacy
surrounding people's personal financial situations, more could be done to help people get a "feel" for life at different
incomes.

This website is intended as a safe place for people to share and explore what different incomes feel like for different 
households. Some users may be motivated to tell their story and help others, especially younger people, make decisions. 
Others may visit the site primarily to gather perspectives. In order to build robust information to draw from,
new users will be required to complete a short survey about their financial situation the past year before they can see 
survey results of other members. Members will have the option of sharing their financial story -- a narrative that 
can include their financial history, changes they've experienced, and the biggest factors influencing their 
feelings about their incomes.

Since many people are likely to explore careers and incomes concurrently, this site will allow people to search
for income experiences based on career, using information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to direct them to the 
appropriate income survey results.
